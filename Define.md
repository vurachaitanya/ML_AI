# ML & AI
-	AI (1950)->ML(1980)->Deep Learning(2010)
-	Data science - Data analytic.  
-	Image processing – computer vision
-	ML uses algorithm and DL also Algorithm 
-	Using more and more data we can create algorithm to extract the data using tools to get some analysis to start business at that location.
-	Predictive maintenance which tells your when the device failed if same stress is been used etc. 
-	 ML – man learning bike and after few attempts we learn bike in some time. Same machine learning using the data and extracts the pattern. Mathematical algorithms. 
-	Human -  learns from experiences
-	Machines - follow instructions
-	Machine learning - making computers learn from experiences ie data.
-	ML – is a field of computer science that gives computers that ability to learn without being explicit programmed
-	More data more patterns complicity.
-	Customer data which personal details, age, has credit card, in active, exited etc using mean medium and standard deviation to get the details. Linear regression & neural network. 
-	We can use ML for financial prediction, fraud detection, loan approval, predictive maintenances, churn prediction, sentimental analysis, machine translation, data mining, web clicks, medical records, and diagnostics. 
-	New business of beverages placed in entire city but vending machine, so he setup an IOT to each device and set the priorities which is center of city which has more business, when to replace etc can be predicted for better business.
-	Big data – distributed data, big data analysis.
# Types of ML Learning
## Supervised learning: 
-	Learning with a labeled training set, gmail spam detector with training set of already labeled emails. 
-	We can’t use based on past data, so that it would only detect past fraud transactions but will not detect new fraud so need to use unsupervised learning.  
## Unsupervised learning: 
-	Discovering patterns in unlabeled data. Cluster similar (same set of patterning identified) documents based on the text content. 
-	EX::::: Google news: creates news based on clusters like time, location, region, language, age will help to give better results and filter and share the results to users
-	They give patterns like national health care get data based on the location they search pattern to identify which part of state getting similar disease using clusters for different diseases in same city.
## Reinforcement learning: 
-	Used in space research, sometimes data is not insufficient or don’t have enough data
-	Pre build strategy will not work in Chess game with new person which we did not analyzed. Logic should be built dynamically.
-	We reward based learning like every win will give positive reward and failed games with negative rewards, at certain point it will build logic with positive rewards.
## Supervised learning:
-	Classification: you know possible solution, flight can be delayed is classification (discrete set of possible outcomes/answers)
-	Regression : you don’t know all possible answers, stock price of SBI or tata steel, flight can be delayed with how many minutes and hours (detecting an anomaly in a general pattern)
## Unsupervised learning:
-	Clustering: categorization of samples based on similarity in features.
-	Adoptive detection: detecting an anomaly in a general pattern.  Anomaly detection for fraud, Gmail access if you use from new device you get anomaly. If you keep using you stop and it adapts our recent pattern. 
-	Recommendation system: Amazon recommendation based on the pattern you search and recommend category to you.
# ML Data modeling has below steps:
Step 1:
-	Data cleaning
-	Finding the best features (takes time 60% to 70%)
-	Ex: Understanding statistics, probability and data interpretation skills (business goal)

Step 2:
-	Preparing the ML model which can learn from the data and understand the pattern
-	Ex: ML – Mathematics and implementation 

ML vs DL : In ML you need to create algorithm and DL it will learning from Data.
## Deep learning: 
-	DL is part of the ML field of learning representation of data. Exceptional effective at learning patterns.
