# ML & AI
-	AI (1950)->ML(1980)->Deep Learning(2010)
-	Data science - Data analytic.  
-	Image processing – computer vision
-	ML uses algorithm and DL also Algorithm 
-	Using more and more data we can create algorithm to extract the data using tools to get some analysis to start business at that location.
-	Predictive maintenance which tells your when the device failed if same stress is been used etc. 
-	 ML – man learning bike and after few attempts we learn bike in some time. Same machine learning using the data and extracts the pattern. Mathematical algorithms. 
-	Human -  learns from experiences
-	Machines - follow instructions
-	Machine learning - making computers learn from experiences ie data.
-	ML – is a field of computer science that gives computers that ability to learn without being explicit programmed
-	More data more patterns complicity.
-	Customer data which personal details, age, has credit card, in active, exited etc using mean medium and standard deviation to get the details. Linear regression & neural network. 
-	We can use ML for financial prediction, fraud detection, loan approval, predictive maintenances, churn prediction, sentimental analysis, machine translation, data mining, web clicks, medical records, and diagnostics.
